# Hi

Hi, Iâ€™m Moritz! (he/him)

I am a 16yo programmer who lives in germany and enjoys low-level programming languages.

I mostly like to code game-engines and programming languages but unfortunately I
lost a lot of stuff because my computer kinda died and I wasn't keeping backups.

Currently I am enjoying Rust, because Rust ðŸ¦€
I wanna get into Go though, so google can spy on me some more

I use Artix linux btw, so I can feel superior to Arch users,
the only problem is that discord doesn't work and I have absolutely no clue why.

Feel free to message me whenever you want, I like meeting new people
